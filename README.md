# **LANCERHUB- A Freelancerâ€™s Workplace**
#### DOMAIN - BUSINESS
## MOTIVE
The main motive behind this project is to create a platform for a freelancer. We have LinkedIn for professionals, Instagram for influencers but there is limited space for a freelancer. Even in those limited spaces, a freelancer is restricted to just applying for a gig.
Through this idea, we want freelancers to showcase their work and skills. A transparent platform where a company can go through the profile of a freelancer before hiring him/her.

## PROCESS
We initially started out with just 1 problem statement. The reason why we selected this problem statement is because FREELANCING IS THE NEW NORMAL. And in a group of 5, 2 were freelancers who faced difficulties in finding gigs on LinkedIn or openly sharing their work on social media platforms like Instagram. There is always a confusion whether to make content sound informal or professional. 
Lancerhub is here to solve this problem.
We first create the pointers as features of our website. 
When we started working on the website, we realized we want it to be our pitching ground. So, we decided to create a small app explaining the working of our idea.

## FEATURES
In this project, we are going to make a platform where freelancers and the company directly connect and make a direct contract of their work. We are going to make two interfaces one is of the freelancer and the other is of the company. Freelancers can upload their content, design, and anything on their profile but at first, they have to upload their resume. Companies can hire them as per their content and work. To make sure that the content of the freelancer is not copied we are going to tokenize the content. If any freelancer has given the authorization of their content to any other freelancer then the history of that content is also there in the profile of the freelancer. Freelancers can also apply for contract-based work or for the job to the company which is going to be rated as per the review of the previous freelancer that has already worked with them. Similarly, freelancers are also going to be rated by the company. If any company finds the content or the work of any freelancer interesting then they can follow them and gets an update if they will upload any new content. So basically we are going to make a platform that's the combination of LinkedIn and Upwork with additional features of Instagram like follow/unfollow. 

####
All in all, LancerHub can be a one point solution to all the difficulties faced by a freelancer. In the era of working in your own space, in your own way, at your own time- freelancing is what is going to be the go to option and hence, we provide a way to make freelancing efficient.
